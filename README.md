# LaLiga-ML-Project
This project consists of using web scraping to obtain a data set and then training a machine learning model based off of my data set to predict games for the future La Liga seasons.

In this project I used:
- Pandas
- BeautifulSoup
- Scikit-learn
- Python Coding Language

The predictions.md file contains the table of the predictions that my machine learning model outputed for the future matches of the La Liga season.
